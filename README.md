<h1 align="center"> First Person Movement Unity Game </h1> <br>

In this game, you play as a chicken collecting 10 eggs worth 50 points each to reach a score of 500. With first-person perspective, you'll navigate through a world full of obstacles, using mechanics such as climbing stairs, jumping, and opening/closing doors. The game includes object manipulation mechanics where you can pick up, hold, drop, and throw mushrooms to flip boxes and uncover hidden eggs.

# Implementation
In the game, elements such as a first-person perspective view and the ability to move around, including walking, climbing stairs, jumping, falling to the ground, opening and closing doors, collecting eggs, counting points, picking up and putting down objects, as well as throwing them, have been designed from scratch.

I also made sure that the player does not walk into elements such as stairs, walls, buildings, walls, rocks, and trees. These elements should be avoided. The chicken (the main character in the game) is also unable to swim naturally, so entering the water is also impossible.

Player can pick up, put down or throw mushrooms. Thrown mushrooms bounce off other objects instead of passing through them. They can be thrown with varying force depending on the player's speed.

To collect all the necessary points the player has to move empty boxes. It can only be achieved by hitting them with thrown mushrooms.
